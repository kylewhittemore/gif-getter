# gif-getter

##Big Picture
* I started by creating the basic homework.  I thought that the format would look nice
* with a searchbar and a full page gif container.  After poking around at Giphy's API docs,
* it seemed like the trending and random features would be nice to include as well.

##Goals
* experiment with more bootstrap components
* practice working with an API
* practice event delegation

##The App
* You are welcomed with a smattering of random gifs.  In the navbar you are able to add more
* random gifs, or implement another option.  The other options are to fetch trending gifs
* to make a new search, or to re-use a favorite search.  The new search feature allows the user 
* to filter the search, and the add to favorites button will add the previous search to the 
* favorites.  Clear clears the gifs.  More...! will get the next ten gifs from giphy for a given 
* search.

##The other html/js documents
* I thought that it would be interesting to use firebase for this app to 
* store the favorites but have not finished.
